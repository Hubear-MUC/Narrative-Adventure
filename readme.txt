Narrative Adventure 1.1
-----------------------

The final adventure game announced in the previous projects that were written as supporting projects to this one.

The game got renamed to "Narrative Adventure" instead of "Narrated Adventure", originally accidentally, but I thought this name also sounds quite well.

It is a text adventure describing to you the scenes in which you are on the screen (terminal window) and asks you for actions you want to do.

You can move around in the game environment by entering the letters for the directions for north (n), south (s), east (e) or west (w).

Depending on what you do you will either lose the game or win.

In version 1.1 the game content was redesigned a bit, so in case of a failure- action of the player the game does not just simply state "no.", but "You lost.", which looks more clear and detailed in my oppinion.

In the previous version of the narrative adventure the code space was just enough to implement the "no.", however this time a more detailed version was possible to implement.
